* TODO GENERAL
** TODO Set up Eigen for Sparse Matrix Representation
** TODO Set up Cppunit for TESTING
** DONE Set up Doxygen for Documentation

* TODO Image Reconstruction
** TODO Add Transfer Function 
   - id() for simple reconstruction of unprocessed image

* TODO Gauss
** DONE Debug Gauss padding
** TODO How to represent spatial support?
   - n left/right around zero in each direction? (current solution)
   - Interval of support? [-a,b]
** TODO Make Gauss SHIFTABLE
   - currently centered fixed around zero => has to be shiftable to a range value (grayscale [0,255])

* TODO OPTIMIZATION
** TODO Represent Grayscale color as Byte
   -> Problem: messes up row-major format -> implications for fftw3 which expects row-major?
